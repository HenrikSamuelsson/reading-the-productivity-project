# Reading - The Productivity Project

Compilation of material from when reading the book The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey, Crown Currency 2016.

## Challenges

The book contains challenges which are practical exercises to be completed by the reader. Below are notes from when I did the challenges from the book.

### Challenge 1 - The Values Challenge

Challenge from chapter 1 "Where to Start".

#### About Challenge 1

Goal of this challenge is to get motivated to becoming more productive. To think about the benefits that comes from being more productive. It follows that this challenge is also to become motivated to read the whole book.

#### Solution Challenge 1

It is unclear why we humans even exist, and what we should spend our short time living here on Earth on. But it seems reasonable that we should try to make some impact that can help the coming generations after we are dead and gone.

In my opinion we should try to expand understanding about how things work, and then use this knowledge to create something useful for us living now, but also for the future generations.

When creating we need to be careful not to fall into the trap of creating something that there already is a solution for. Deep knowledge in the field that we are working in is a necessity to come up with something new.

If I had **two more hours** each day I would split these hours into two blocks:

1. One hour **learning** more, by reading books, articles, and taking courses
2. One hour **innovation** inspired by what I learn
