# Reading - The Productivity Project

Compilation of material from when reading the book The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey, Crown Currency 2016.

## Challenges

The book contains challenges which are practical exercises to be completed by the reader. Below are notes from when I did the challenges from the book.

### The Values Challenge

It is unclear why we humans even exist, and what we should spend our short time living here on Earth on. But it seems reasonable that we should try to make some impact that can help the coming generations after we are dead and gone.

In my opinion we should try to understand how things work and then use this knowledge to create something useful for us living now but also for the future generations. But we need to be careful to not fall into the trap of creating something that there already is a solution for.

If I had **two more hours** each day I would split these hours into two blocks:

1. **Learning** more by reading books, articles, and taking courses
2. **Innovation** of something new and unique based on what I have learned
